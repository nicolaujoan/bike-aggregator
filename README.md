- pd: solution was the incorrect name of the host

- the volume is mounted on /opt/mysql_data, maybe in localhost is ok to put it in the project folder structure

- start to test some use cases and create some queries with sequelize (transactions, supertest, jest)

- divide the docker-compose files to do different profiles

- try the repository and use it with mongoDB atlas if it is possible

- make some data migration/generation

- try to think how to implement a microservices architecture
